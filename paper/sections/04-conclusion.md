## Conclusion

The tools discussed in this paper are widely used, largely due to the fact that they are free. A huge advantage of using popular tools like these is that there is a huge body of documentation, both official and not. The publishers of the tool provide very useful materials for learning, but there is a plethora of tutorials, videos, and blogs published by individuals that new users can learn from. Websites like StackOverflow also allow users to find examples of solutions to problems similar to theirs, and ask new questions of experts. It's quite remarkable how much valuable learning material is accessible for free over the internet.
